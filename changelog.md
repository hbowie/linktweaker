Version 1.10 (2013-05-25)
-------------------------

* Changed file: references to always use five slashes at the start of the path, since this seems to be compatible with all the browsers I've tested with (and anything else fails with Firefox).

Version 1.00 (2013-03-20)
-------------------------

* Initial release of Link Tweaker.
